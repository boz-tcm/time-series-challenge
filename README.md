> Project: Module 11 Time-Series Challenge

> Background: With over 200 million users, MercadoLibre is the most popular e-commerce site in Latin America.

> Purpose: In this activity, we use our newfound Python, time-series, and Prophet skills to to find out whether the ability to predict search traffic at MercadoLibre can translate into successfully trading the stock.

## General Information
- Our project was designed to use Scikit-learn libraries, including sklearn preprocessing, cluster, decomposition, and algorithms KMeans and PCA to analyze factors, or features, in the cryptocurrency market.

## Technologies Used
- Python Version 3.10.12
- Prophet Version 1.1.4
- Jupyter Notebook within the VS Code IDE for both Jupyter Notebook 'crypto_investments.ipynb' and a README markdown file.

## Features
