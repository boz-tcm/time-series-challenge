> Project: Module 11 Time-Series Challenge

> Background: With over 200 million users, MercadoLibre is the most popular e-commerce site in Latin America.

> Purpose: In this activity, we use our newfound Python, time-series, and Prophet model skills to find out whether the ability to predict search traffic at MercadoLibre may translate into successfully trading the stock.
